# Source-to-Target Editor Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan implements a comprehensive dual-editor system that transforms the application from a PDF-specific TEI editor into a general source-to-target document processing tool. The system supports:
- **Source Editor**: PDF viewer OR XML editor (left pane)
- **Target Editor**: XML editor (right pane)
- **Flexible Workflows**: PDFâ†’XML, XMLâ†’XML, XMLâ†’Schema generation
- **Generic Extraction**: Any source format to any target format via pluggable extractors

## Current Status: Core Infrastructure Complete âœ…

- [ ] `state.xml` â†’ `state.target` (with backward compatibility alias)
- [ ] Add `state.sourceType` and `state.targetType` properties
- [ ] Update all state references throughout codebase

**UI Component Names**:
- [ ] `ui.toolbar.pdf` â†’ `ui.toolbar.source`
- [ ] `ui.toolbar.xml` â†’ `ui.toolbar.target`
- [ ] `pdfViewer` â†’ `sourceViewer` or `sourceEditor`

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Migration**: Implement new features alongside existing ones
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain full compatibility with existing PDF-TEI workflows
3. **User Testing**: Continuous validation with real users and workflows
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core dual-editor, add advanced features gradually

### Technical Principles
- **Source Agnostic**: Source editor handles any input type (PDF, XML, etc.)
- **Target Focused**: Target editor specialized for XML editing and validation
- **Workflow Driven**: UI adapts to sourceâ†’target workflow requirements
- **Plugin Extensible**: New source types and extractors can be added easily

### Migration Path
1. Implement dual editor layout (preserves existing single-editor workflows)
2. Add source type detection and basic XML source editing
3. Enhance extraction system for XMLâ†’XML workflows
4. Gradually rename variables and functions with deprecation warnings
5. Complete semantic refactoring while maintaining backward compatibility

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All existing PDF-TEI workflows continue to work unchanged
- [ ] XML-to-XML workflows are fully functional
- [ ] Schema generation and validation works end-to-end
- [ ] New source types can be added without breaking changes
- [ ] Code semantics clearly reflect source-target architecture
