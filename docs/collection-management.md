# Collection Management

(ai-generated, not very useful yet)

Collections in the PDF-TEI Editor help organize documents into logical groups for better project management, access control, and workflow organization.

## Understanding Collections

### What Are Collections?

Collections are organizational containers that group related documents together:

- **Project-Based**: Documents for specific research projects
- **Thematic Groups**: Documents by subject, period, or type
- **Processing Stages**: Documents at different stages of processing
- **Institutional**: Documents by source institution or department
- **User Collections**: Personal document collections

### Collection Hierarchy

- **Root Collections**: Top-level organizational units
- **Nested Organization**: Collections can contain sub-collections
- **Cross-Collection Access**: Documents can be referenced across collections
- **Default Collection**: New documents go to `__inbox` by default

## Viewing Collections

### Collection Display

Collections are visible in several places:

- **PDF Dropdown**: Shows collection structure in document selection
- **Document Information**: Current document's collection is displayed
- **Extraction Dialog**: Collection selection during extraction process

### Collection Information

Each collection displays:

- **Collection Name**: Human-readable collection identifier
- **Document Count**: Number of documents in the collection
- **Access Level**: Your permission level for the collection
- **Description**: Purpose and scope of the collection (if available)
