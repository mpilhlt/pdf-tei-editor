      <body>used to analyse texts for scientific research. According to the legal definition in the <lb/>Digital Single Market Directive (hereinafter: the DSM Directive), 1 TDM is &quot;any auto <lb/>mated analytical technique aimed at analysing text and data in digital form in order to <lb/>generate information which includes but is not limited to patterns, trends and correla <lb/>tions&quot;. 2 To conduct TDM, it is necessary to reproduce the source material, and in col <lb/>laborative research projects also to communicate it to the public. Such acts are copy <lb/>right-relevant if the source material is protected by copyright. In such cases, perform <lb/>ing TDM requires the authorisation of the rights holders unless a statutory exception <lb/>applies. With the DSM Directive, new copyright exceptions regarding TDM have been <lb/>introduced into the EU legal framework (see art. 3 and 4 DSM Directive). Still, TDM <lb/>encounters limitations concerning the storage, publication, and re-use of datasets <lb/>derived from copyrighted texts: According to the TDM exception for scientific <lb/>research, the source material may only be shared with a limited circle of persons for <lb/>joint scientific research or with third persons for quality evaluation purposes. It can <lb/>only be stored long-term if it was collected for research purposes by cultural heritage <lb/>institutions, research organisations or individual researchers belonging to a research <lb/>organisation. 3 Such limitations, however, run counter to the principles of open science <lb/>in research which, like in many other fields, play an important role in Digital Humani <lb/>ties and make it difficult to replicate or verify the results of existing studies, or to build <lb/>on earlier work when current, in-copyright materials are concerned. <lb/>This paper will focus on Derived Text Formats (DTFs) as a possible way to avoid <lb/>such limitations by using statutory exceptions to transform the source material into <lb/>formats which no longer contain copyrighted content. It will discuss the legal require <lb/>ments to create DTFs from copyright-protected material, as well as the legal criteria to <lb/>determine the applicability (or not) of copyright to DTFs according to German law. <lb/>Copyright law is heavily influenced by EU directives, so these will play a significant <lb/>role throughout this analysis. <lb/>B. What are derived text formats (DTFs) <lb/>DTFs have been described as extracted features for non-consumptive research. 4 They <lb/>are systematically generated representations of a base text, which allow the application <lb/>II. <lb/></body> <!-- here again, the subtitle numbers are misplaced -->

They can be produced in such a way that, on the one <lb/>hand, the resulting representation still allows for the application of at least one research <lb/>method, while, on the other hand, the representation is no longer protected by copy <lb/>right. <lb/>The basic idea behind DTFs is to selectively remove specific pieces of informa <lb/>tion, particularly copyright-relevant features, from in-copyright texts to transform <lb/>copyright-protected material into DTFs which no longer contain copyright-relevant <lb/>features and therefore, are no longer affected by copyright restrictions. Additionally, if <lb/>the material cannot be &apos;humanly&apos; read and understood in order to intellectually assimi <lb/>late its content (Baudry, 2023), 5 making it available to the public is less likely to affect <lb/>the interests of copyright holders. At the same time, such materials are still suitable <lb/>for a variety of TDM tasks in the Digital Humanities, such as simple quantification <lb/>of words and other linguistics features, stylometry and authorship attribution, topic <lb/>modelling, or the training of machine learning models. <lb/>There are many ways to create DTFs from source texts, but they can be roughly <lb/>divided into three groups 6 listed below, with examples for reference. <lb/>1) Statistical DTFs: The first method is to extract textual features from texts (e.g. <lb/>tokens, lemmata, n-grams, sentences, lines, paragraphs or pages) and their corre <lb/>sponding statistical information, such as length, absolute/relative frequency or <lb/>sequence. Such extracted, descriptive information can then be published for text <lb/>analysis tasks. Examples of such DTFs are the &quot;Hathi Trust Extracted Features&quot; <lb/>(see e.g., Jett et al. 2020, Organisciak et al. 2017, Parulian et al. 2022) and the <lb/>&quot;Google Books Ngram Datasets&quot; (see e.g., Michel et al. 2011, El-Ebshihy et al. <lb/>2018, Richey &amp; Taylor 2020). <lb/>2) Transformative DTFs: The second method and the idea is to artificially add some <lb/>&quot;noise&quot; to the original text, which reduces its readability (Schöch et al. 2020). <lb/>More precisely, different kinds of transformation are being applied to the source <lb/>2012, pp. 169-174, https://aclanthology.org/P12-3029; S.

Barth, J. Calvo Tello, K. Du, P. Genêt, L. Keller, J. Knappen, Liste der Abgeleiteten <lb/>Textformate (working title), forthcoming, 2025. <lb/>151 <lb/>Iacino et al. • Legal status of Derived Text Formats <lb/>151 <lb/>RuZ 5. Jg. 3/2024 <lb/>10.5771/2699-1284-2024-3-149 -am 11.08.2025, 18:08:59. https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/de/agb -Open Access -<lb/>texts (e.g. removing the sequence information by randomizing the order of the <lb/>words and/or randomly replacing a certain proportion of words in texts with <lb/>their corresponding part-of-speech tags or with a placeholder token) and the trans <lb/>formed texts can then be published in different formats (plain text, JSON, XML, <lb/>tabular formats) as research data. 7 One recent example of this can be found in <lb/>the TextGrid-Repository, with TEI files containing metadata, structure and lexical <lb/>information but with the tokens in randomized order (Calvo Tello et al. 2025). 8 <lb/>3) Language model-based DTFs: The third method is to train a language model using <lb/>the copyrighted texts and publish the model (e.g. topic model, static / contextual <lb/>ized word embedding model, or large language model). In this way, the informa <lb/>tion contained in texts (including for example the frequency and the context of <lb/>words) is mapped to and represented in an algebraic vector space instead of the <lb/>usual symbolic character system. Information in this format could be used for e.g <lb/>context-dependent semantic analysis of individual words or fine-tuning of the large <lb/>language models for specific analysis procedures 9 . <lb/>It should be noted that DTFs are usually published along with information about <lb/>the texts, such as data about the structure of the text (if it contains paratexts, verses, <lb/>images, etc.) and metadata of various kinds, such as details of the composition of the <lb/>files, title and other descriptive information about the work(s) it contains, the author <lb/>and other agents (such as publishers, translators) involved in the process, etc. This is <lb/>the case for Statistical and Transformative DTFs and most of the examples mentioned <lb/>above and in Schöch et al. (2020). Even in cases with poorer metadata, such as Google <lb/>N-grams, some metadata is needed to be able to use them for analysis. As Burnard <lb/>points out, &quot;without metadata, the investigator has nothing but disconnected words of <lb/>unknowable provenance or authenticity&quot; (2004). This is an important feature of textual <lb/>data, and could have important implications for the criteria for copyright status of <lb/>DTFs. <lb/>7 Note that for a number of kinds of statistical DTFs, a conversion into transformative DTFs <lb/>with identical information content is possible, and vice versa, so that these two types are not <lb/>necessarily fundamentally different. <lb/>8 https://textgridrep.org/search?query=&amp;order=relevance&amp;limit=20&amp;mode=list&amp;filter=format <lb/>:application%2Fxml%3Bderived%3Dtrue&amp;filter=project.id%3ATGPR-8b44ca41-6fa1-9b49-<lb/>67b7-6374d97e29eb. <lb/>9 See e.g. C.

For plain text files, metadata is often stored separately in a tabular format or in the <lb/>name file in a precarious way. Other formats, such as JSON or XML-TEI, allow meta <lb/>data to be encoded in a structured way, facilitating better compliance with the FAIR <lb/>principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016). <lb/>Copyright implications of creating DTFs <lb/>This section will discuss in which cases creating DTFs from copyright-protected <lb/>source material qualifies as a copyright-relevant act and therefore can only be carried <lb/>out with authorisation of the rights holders or under a statutory exception. <lb/>Copyright protection of the source material <lb/>This deliverable concerns only the creation of DTFs from copyright-protected source <lb/>material. The reader should be aware, however, that while a great majority of texts <lb/>(novels, poems, song lyrics, news, blog posts, letters, diary entries…) meet the original <lb/>ity threshold required for copyright protection, some texts are copyright-free (i.e., in <lb/>the public domain). This is the case if: <lb/> § Copyright has reached its term, which generally happens 70 years after the death of <lb/>the author 10 OR <lb/> § The text is expressly excluded from copyright by a statutory provision; under <lb/>German law, this is the case of &quot;official works&quot;; 11 <lb/> § The text fails to meet the originality threshold, e.g. because it&apos;s too short for <lb/>the originality (German: persönliche geistige Schöpfung) to manifest itself 12 (some <lb/>tweets, slogans), or because it&apos;s very commonplace (e.g., consists of expressions <lb/>commonly used in the given context 13 , such as &quot;I wish you a merry Christmas <lb/>and a happy new year&quot;), or because the author had to follow some strict formal <lb/></listBibl>

			<body>constraints (this could be the case of some product descriptions or user manuals). <lb/>Public domain texts can be freely copied and shared, so there is limited practical <lb/>interest in deriving DTFs from them (at least in the context of copyright concerns); but <lb/>since they can also be freely modified, deriving and sharing DTFs from such texts is <lb/>not in any way restricted by copyright law. <lb/>III. <lb/>1. <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>10 See § 64 Urheberrechtsgesetz (UrhG) for the German legal framework, https://www.gesetze <lb/>-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/. <lb/>11 See § 5 UrhG. <lb/>12 The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that texts as short as 11 consecutive words <lb/>can be protected by copyright; however, very short texts (around 4 words and shorter) are <lb/>generally regarded as too short to be protected by copyright, see CJEU, judgement of 16 <lb/>July 2009, Infopaq, Case C-5/08, ECLI:EU:C:2009:465, https://curia.europa.eu/juris/docum <lb/>ent/document.jsf?docid=72482&amp;doclang=EN. <lb/>13 See e.g. LG München I, Urteil vom 12.12.2017, 33 O 15792/16, https://openjur.de/u/970910. <lb/>html. <lb/>153 <lb/>Iacino et al. • Legal status of Derived Text Formats <lb/>153 <lb/>RuZ 5. Jg. 3/2024 <lb/>10.5771/2699-1284-2024-3-149 -am 11.08.2025, 18:08:59. https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/de/agb -Open Access -<lb/>Copyright-relevance of creating DTFs <lb/>Two scenarios need to be distinguished. On the one hand, if the outcome of the <lb/>creation process, the DTF itself, still contains copyright protected-source material, <lb/>the creation of the DTF necessarily entailed reproductions of the source material, <lb/>independently from how it was created. On the other hand, if the DTF no longer <lb/>contains copyright-protected source material, the creation process might either not <lb/>have entailed any acts of reproduction or might have required (technically necessary) <lb/>acts of reproduction. Therefore, It is necessary to take a closer look at the creation <lb/>process itself before analysing whether the result of the process, the DTF itself, is still <lb/>protected by copyright. As it will be demonstrated, a distinction can be made between <lb/>manually and automatically creating DTFs. <lb/>Manually deriving DTFs <lb/>Theoretically, one could derive DTFs, especially Statistical DTFs, entirely manually, <lb/>e.g. by manually counting words, characters, etc., and then presenting the results in a <lb/>chart or a diagram. Although certainly time-consuming and inefficient in the digital <lb/>age, manual derivation of Statistical DTFs possibly can be a copyright-irrelevant act, <lb/>if the source text is not reproduced (copied) in the process, and only pure copyright-<lb/>free information is extracted from the text (e.g., there are 3 occurrences of the word <lb/>&quot;kerfuffle&quot; in the text, the text consists of 772 sentences, the most common sentence <lb/>length is 5 words, etc.). However, this is of course a time-consuming and error-prone <lb/>process that does not scale well to larger amounts of text; it is therefore of very limited <lb/>practical relevance. <lb/>Automatically deriving DTFs <lb/>Needless to say, the most convenient and feasible way to derive DTFs is by automated <lb/>means. However, a piece of software used to derive DTFs necessarily copies (large) <lb/>passages of source texts, even if only copyright-free information is extracted from the <lb/>text. It is interesting to realise that an action that would &quot;normally&quot; be free from <lb/>constraints may fall within the ambit of an exclusive right just because it is performed <lb/>with the aid of information technology. <lb/>Copies that are only temporarily stored in the RAM are also copyright-relevant. <lb/>The wording of Article 2 of the InfoSoc Directive 14 and of § 16(1) UrhG, defining <lb/>the exclusive right of reproduction, leaves no doubts as to the fact that all acts of <lb/>reproduction, even technically necessary acts of temporary reproductions, are copy <lb/>right-relevant: <lb/></listBibl>
