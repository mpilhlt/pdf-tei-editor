# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## General tone

- Don't be too congratulatory. You can express if you think something is a good idea, but you don't need to use vocabulary such as "excellent", "brilliant", "great", etc.
- If you think there might be a problem with the user's idea, push back. Don't assume the user's ideas are necessarily correct. Ask if you should go with their idea, but also suggest alternatives.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Run only tests for changed files
npm run test:changed

# Run all JavaScript unit tests
npm run test:js

# Run all Python integration tests
npm run test:py

# Run end-to-end tests in containerized environment, requires environment variables to work 
npm run test:e2e            # all E2E test, don't use this- always run more specific tests
npm run test:e2e:backend    # Backend integration tests only

# Pass environment variables to E2E test containers
npm run test:e2e -- --env GROBID_SERVER_URL --env GEMINI_API_KEY
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "extraction" --env GROBID_SERVER_URL

# Use custom .env file for E2E tests
npm run test:e2e -- --dotenv-path .env.testing

```

### Key Files

- Entry point: `app/src/app.js`
- UI elements definitions via `@typedef`: `app/src/ui.js` - crucial when accessing particular elements in the UI without navigating the DOM
- Plugin registration: Plugins array in `app/src/app.js:71-76`
- Plugins: `app/src/plugins.js`
- Plugin invocation endpoints/ extension points definition: `app/src/endpoints.js`
- Application state object definition: `app/src/state.js`

### Key Directories:

Read `prompts/architecture.md` when you need to understand the system design

- `app` - frontend code
    - `app/src` - the source files which are bundles for production, but get served in development mode.
    - `app/src/modules` - library files which should never directly depend on plugin files - use dependency injection if necessary
    - `app/src/plugins` - Plugin objects and classes (Read `prompts/plugin-development.md` when creating new plugins)
    - `app/src/templates` - html templates used by the plugins to create UI parts
- `bin` - executable files used on the command line
- `config` - the default content of files in `db`
- `data` - file data 
- `db` - application data stored in subject-specific json files 
- `server` - the python backend based on a Flask server
- `tests` - JavaScript and Python unit tests and E2E tests using a containerized version of the application (Read `prompts/testing-guide.md` when creating or debuggingtests)


## Detailed Documentation

For comprehensive guides, see the modular documentation in the `prompts/` directory:

- **[Development Commands](prompts/development-commands.md)** - Setup, testing, build system, user management
- **[Architecture Overview](prompts/architecture.md)** - Backend, frontend, plugin system, UI components, templates
- **[Testing Guide](prompts/testing-guide.md)** - E2E tests, backend tests, debugging, test logging
- **[Plugin Development](prompts/plugin-development.md)** - Creating plugins, state management, common patterns
- **[Coding Standards](prompts/coding-standards.md)** - JSDoc requirements, best practices, conventions

## Important Reminders

### Development Workflow

1. **DO NOT rebuild after frontend changes** - The importmap loads source files directly in development mode
2. Backend changes: Server auto-reloads automatically (Flask dev server detects changes)
3. Schema updates: Delete `schema/cache/` to refresh XSD cache
4. Building is only needed for production and is handled by pre-push git hooks

### Critical Rules

- **Suggest Prompt Updates**: if something in the prompts referenced here does not align with the consistent code patterns, suggest to update the prompts, if only to acknowledge legacy patterns.
- **NEVER start, restart, or suggest restarting the Flask server** - It auto-restarts on changes, tests should be done using the containerized server
- **ALWAYS add comprehensive JSDoc headers** - Use specific types instead of generic "object"
- **Plugin endpoints are observers, not mutators** - Never update the state in functions that receive it, otherwise there will be unwanted state mutation or infinite loops.
- **Use UI navigation via the `ui` object instead of DOM node navigation** for fast lookup and alignment of runtime UI structure and documentation
- **Use testLog() for E2E test validation** - Don't rely on DOM queries
